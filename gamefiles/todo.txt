MIN DEMO
- add crown + jetpack
- endings (1 & 2) / credits
~ sound effects
~ finish map (need to connect core & add camera zones, figure out how to handle top of map)
+ particles

CAN DO ON OWN
- make jetpack a pickup
- add controller logic into ammo/input.lua
- toggling fullscreen

- timer & %completion screen
- screenshake / effects

NEED HELP
- music
- add in real sprites
- add map remixes (low effort version... just do new game+, maybe sprinkle in random obstacles

total resolution is 320 x 180. aesthetic is "raiding creepy/weird alien ruins
for dangerous artifacts". pretty vague right now, so you'd have a lot of
freedom with the direction to take things. the only things i'd ask is that 1)
the player's head isn't covered so you can see her eyes and 2) avoid anything
with a military theme

- 5 bosses (from around 100 x 100 to 50 x 50, each with 2-3 frames of animation)
- 1 player (16x32, around 10 frames)
- 2 small tilesets (each around 20 16x16 tiles)
- 2 simple backgrounds (tiled, 640 x 360, each with 2 layers)
- a handful of small objects (maybe 12 or so, all around 16x16 or 32x32)
