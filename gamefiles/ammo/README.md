Ammo is currently undergoing an overhaul for the next major version. Documentation applies to v1.2.1.

**README for 1.2.1**

Ammo is a simple, flexible organisational library for the [LÖVE](http://love2d.org) (or, Love2D) game engine. Its core is an world/entity system with a few other tools like cameras, sound pools, etc. In addition it comes with other optional modules which streamline physics integration, tweening, asset management, and input handling.

Currently designed for LÖVE 0.11.x, but will most likely work with LÖVE 0.9.x - 0.10.x.
